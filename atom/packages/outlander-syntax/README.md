# Outlander Syntax

Outlander is a syntax theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/). This theme is an almost clone of the [Tomorrow Night Eighties](https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme) color scheme by @chriskempson, save for a few tweaks to keep it inline with [Outlander-ui](https://github.com/mthadley/outlander-UI).
