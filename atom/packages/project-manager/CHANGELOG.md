Bugfix

## 1.10.0

If an error still comes up, try updating to latest version of Atom, currently 0.135

## 1.8.0
Changed the way settings work which mean that if you have used any of the old settings, you have to redo them. This way all settings that can be set from the settings view/config.cson can be project specific.

```CoffeeScript
# Old way
'settings':
  'setTabLength': 2

# New way
'settings':
  'editor.tabLength': 2
  'editor.showIndentGuide': true
  'project-manager.showPath': true
```

the current window, but with a fix to it.

## 1.7.3

- Added brackets around hostname in `projects.[hostname].cson` to make it clearer that that part will change to use the hostname of the environment.

## 1.7.2
- Updated changelog

## 1.7.1
- Updated readme

## 1.7
*Something seems to have happend during publish so 1.6 was skipped*
- Project path now shows when saving a project

## 1.5
This update adds an option for **environment specific project** files which are based on your hostname to be able to sync the atom folder between environments without ignoring `projects.cson`.
Enabling this option will create a `projects.[hostname].cson` file.

After enabling this option you will have to manually move the contents of `projects.cson` to the new `projects.[hostname].cson` file. After this `projects.cson`can be delete or left alone.

## 1.4
- Added option to sort by title.
- Added changelog
