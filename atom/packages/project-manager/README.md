![Project Manager](https://raw.github.com/danielbrodin/atom-project-manager/master/project-manager.gif)


Get easy access to all your projects and manage them with project specific settings and options.


## Install
```
$Â apm install project-manager
```
or open Atom and go to Preferences > Install and search for `project-manager`


## Use
### List Projects
`ctrl-cmd-p` (mac) / `alt-shift-P` (win & linux) or `Project Manager: List Projects` in the Command Palette.

You can filter projects by `title`, `group` and `template`.
`group: atom` would list all projects with the group `atom`. Default is `title`

### Save Project
`Project Manager: Save Project` in the Command Palette and write the title you want to save the project as.

### Edit Projects
All projects are saved in a `.cson` file which you can easily reach by searching for `Project Manager: Edit Projects` in the Command Palette.

## Project Settings

setting    | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                           | Default               
-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------
`title`    | `string`  | Projects title. Used in the projects list                                                                                                | `''`                  
`paths`    | `array`   | The folders that will open in the tree view. First path is the main one that counts as the project.                                                   | `[]`                  
`settings` | `Object`  | Enables you to set project specific settings. Everything that goes in the `config.cson` file can go here. It also supports scoped settings.           | `{}`                  
`icon`     | `string`  | Icon that shows in the projects list. It's class-based so can either be a class already provided by Atom like `icon-squirell` or a class of your own. | `'icon-chevron-right'`
`devMode`  | `boolean` | `true` if project should open in dev mode                                                                                                             | `false`               
`group`    | `string`  | Adds a group to the projects list that can be used to group and filter projects                                                                       | `null`                
`template` | `string`  | If you add a project in the `projects.cson` file without `paths` it will count as a template. This way you can easily share settings between projects | `null`                
### Local settings file
All these settings can be added to a `project.cson` file in the root folder of the project. It follows the below example, but without the project key.

### Example
```
projectmanager:
  title: 'Project Manager'
  devMode: true
  group: 'Atom'
  template: 'coffeescript-template'
  paths: [
    '/path/to/project-manager'
  ]
  settings:
    '*':
      'editor.tabLength': 4

'coffeescript-template':
  icon: 'icon-coffeescript'
  settings:
    '.source.coffee':
      'editor.tabLength': 2
      'editor.preferredLineLength': 80
```

## API
The project manager provides a service that you can use in your own Atom packages. To use it, include `project-manager` in the `consumedServices` section of your package.json.

```
"consumedServices": {
    "project-manager": {
      "versions": {
        "^2.2.1": "consumeProjectManager"
      }
    }
  }
```
Then in your package's main module, call methods on the service
```
module.exports =
  doSomethingWithTheCurrentProject: (project) ->

  consumeProjectManager: (PM) ->
    PM.projects.getCurrent (project) =>
      if project
        @doSomethingWithTheCurrentProject(project)
```

### Methods
#### `{Projects}`
- `::getAll`
  - `{Function} callback` - Callback that receives an `Array` of `{Project}`'s
- `::getCurrent`
  - `{Function} callback` - Callback that receives the current `{Project}` or `false` if there is none active
- `::onUpdate`
  - `{Function} callback` - Will be called each time a project have been updated

#### `{Project}`
- `{props}` - Contains all properties of the project like `title`, `paths` and `settings`
- `::open` - Will open the project
- `::isCurrent` - Returns `true` if it's the current project
- `::onUpdate`
  - `{Function} callback` - Will be called when the project have been updated
- `::set` - Will set the property on the project
  - `{String} key`
  - `{Mixed} value`
- `::unset` - Will remove the property from the project
  - `{String} key`
