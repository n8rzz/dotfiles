This project solves some of my problems and I share it in the\nhope that it solves some of yours.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Why doesn't `js-hyperclick` see my jsx files?\n\nThere is a setting in `js-hyperclick` to add additional extensions. My\nconfiguration is `.js, .jsx, .coffee`\n\n## Can you add support for `this.doSomething()`?\n\nNo, There is no way to know for sure what `this` is or what properties it might\nhave. Instead of trying to pick some set of patterns to support and get partly\nright, I'm just not going to support that at all.\n\nIf you want this you might look into http://ternjs.net/, or if you'll switch to\nwriting Flow instead of standard JavaScript [Nuclide has jump to definition\nsupport](http://nuclide.io/docs/languages/flow/#jump-to-definition)\n\n## Will you support AMD?\n\nI just don't see a future in AMD, so I won't invest time in supporting it. I\nused RequireJS for years\n\n[hyperclick]: https://atom.io/packages/hyperclick\n[code-links]: https://atom.io/packages/code-links\n[resolve]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolvehttps://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AsaAyers/js-hyperclick#readme","_id":"js-hyperclick@1.4.2","_shasum":"9e6539d1c8204f4da5424f26fc69dc6ad377f291","_resolved":"file:../d-116413-30939-17cxl0d/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116413-30939-17cxl0d/package.tgz"}
