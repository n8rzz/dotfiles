The diff is updated when any changes are made. New panes are created if less than two panes exist upon run of the package.\n\n![Split Diff in action](https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff/raw/master/demo.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Effect | Default Keymaps |\n| ------- | ------ | --------------- |\n| `Toggle` | Toggles a diff of the text between two side-by-side panes. Creates panes as needed. | ... |\n| `Ignore Whitespace` | Toggles the Ignore Whitespace setting. | ... |\n| `Move to Next Diff` | Scrolls to the next chunk of the diff and highlights it. | `ctrl-alt-n` |\n| `Move to Previous Diff` | Scrolls to the previous chunk of the diff and highlights it. | `ctrl-alt-p` |\n\nThe `Toggle` command is unique; it will create panes as necessary. Here are the situations that could arise:\n\n* If there are **no panes** open, then it will create two *empty* panes to paste your diffs into.\n* If there is **one pane** open, then it will diff the pane against a newly created *empty* pane to paste your diff into.\n* If there are **two panes** open, then it will diff the two panes.\n\nTo stop diffing, simply close one of the panes *or* use the `Toggle` command.\n\n*This package will unfold all folded lines in order to properly align the diff.*\n*It will also temporarily turn off soft wrap in the two panes in order to properly align the diff.*\n\n### Settings\n\n* **Ignore Whitespace** - Will not diff whitespace when this box is checked.\n* **Show Word Diff** - Diffs the words between each line when this box is checked.\n* **Left Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the left editor.\n* **Right Editor Color** - Specifies the highlight color for the right editor.\n\n## Minimap Plugin\n\nGet the [Split Diff minimap plugin](https://atom.io/packages/minimap-split-diff) to make it easier to spot differences!\n\n## Looking for Git Support?\n\nTry the [git-time-machine package](https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine), which uses Split Diff!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff#readme","_id":"split-diff@0.6.3","_shasum":"df812236a40e2a5d79886853cf6cffc21ef46c2c","_from":"git+https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff.git#v0.6.3","_resolved":"git+https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff.git#0b991c0c3b7035b810bbe282773fbd2f5ffe7123"}
