Insert each erb block you'd like as an array with the first element as the opening erb and the 2nd element as the closing erb into rails-snippets's erbBlocks configuration array.\n\nAs an example of how'd look like:\n```\n# config.cson\n\"*\":\n  # all your configs...\n  \"rails-snippets\":\n      erbBlocks: [\n        ['<%=', '%>']\n        ['<%', '%>']\n        ['<%#', '%>']\n      ]\n```\nIf you can stick to the default (above) you don't have to do anything. Otherwise add or remove erb blocks in the order you'd like.\n\n## Conventions\nThe conventions for the snippets are usually the initials for the method.\n\nExamples:\n* For `validates_presence_of` is `vpo`\n* For `has_and_belongs_to_many` is `habtm`\n* For `<%= link_to 'hi', path %>` is `lt` and so on.\n\nAlso if the method has an optional block like `content_tag` (snippet is `ct`), its block it's going to be adding `block` to the shortcut, in this case `ctblock`\n\n## Snippets list\n\nHere are some of my favorites snippets, a complete list of snippets can be seen [directly at the code](https://github.com/joseramonc/rails-snippets/tree/master/snippets) or once the package is installed at Settings > Packages > Rails Snippets\n### `=loop`\n\n![=loop_demo](http://cl.ly/image/2z0j2j043W22/=loop.gif)\n\n### `form_for` and `fsf`\n\n![=form_for fsf](http://cl.ly/image/0s3z1t040k16/form_for.gif)\n\n### `scope` + (`p` `l` `bd` `j` `jp`)\n![=form_for fsf](http://cl.ly/image/2U011O3j343r/scopes.gif)\n* `p`roc\n* `l`ambda\n* `bd` Between dates\n* `j`oins\n* `jp`joins & proc\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joseramonc/rails-snippets/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/joseramonc/rails-snippets#readme","_id":"rails-snippets@2.3.2","_shasum":"4cae62b86972b47cc1916799b9fc6c855f05daa5","_resolved":"file:../d-116315-29400-vbfga1/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116315-29400-vbfga1/package.tgz"}
