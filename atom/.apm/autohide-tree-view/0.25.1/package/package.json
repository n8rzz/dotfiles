When smaller than the value of the minwidth setting, minwidth will be used. |\n| `touchAreaSize` | integer | pixels | 50 | Width of an invisible area at the edge of the screen where touch events will be triggered. |\n| `maxWindowWidth` | integer | pixels | 0 | Max window width for which autohide should be enabled. If on a resize the window width crosses this threshold, autohide will automatically be enabled or disabled. Set to 0 to always have autohide enabled. |\n| `showPinButton` | boolean | none | true | Show a pin button in the tree view that enables/disables autohide. |\n| `autoFocusTreeViewOnHover` | boolean | none | true | Focus and unfocus the tree view on hover events. This setting exists because some people were experiencing issues with the tree view's add/rename dialogs where the dialogs would close almost immediately after opening. See #28 for more details. |\n\n## Touch events\n\nShow/hide the tree view with swiping gestures. For touch events, the [atom-touch-events](https://atom.io/packages/atom-touch-events) package is required. You'll have to re-enable autohide-tree-view, or reload Atom, after installing atom-touch-events for the touch events to work.\n\n## Services provided\n\nautohide-tree-view provides a service for Show, Hide, Enable and Disable actions. To consume the service, put the following in your package's `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"consumedServices\": {\n  \"autohide-tree-view\": {\n    \"versions\": {\n      // refers to the consumer method in your package's main module\n      \"^0.24.0\": \"consumeAutohideTreeViewService\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your package's main module, put this:\n\n```coffee\nconsumeAutohideTreeViewService: (service) ->\n  # show/hide the tree view\n  # @param delay: delay in ms before starting the animation\n  service.show(delay)\n  service.hide(delay)\n  service.isVisible()\n\n  # enable/disable autohide behaviour\n  service.pin()\n  service.unpin()\n  service.isPinned()\n```\n\nThe `show`, `hide`, `pin` and `unpin` methods return a promise that will be resolved once the tree view animation is done. It's resolved value is a boolean, indicating if the animation was finished (`true`) or cancelled (`false`). The promise is rejected if an error occurs during the animation.\n\n`isVisible` and `isPinned` return a boolean, indicating whether the tree view is visible or pinned.\n\nA silly example:\n\n```js\n// open the tree view, and hide it again if\n// it wasn't cancelled\nfunction consumeAutohideTreeViewService(service) {\n  service.show(0).then(function(finished) {\n    if(finished) {\n      service.hide();\n    }\n  }, function(err) {\n    // something went wrong!!\n    console.error(err);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## Issues/suggestions\n\nPlease file issues or suggestions on the [issues page on github](https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view/issues/new), or even better, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view/pulls)\n\n## License\n\n&copy; 2015 Olmo Kramer <br> [MIT License](LICENSE.md)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view#readme","_id":"autohide-tree-view@0.25.1","_shasum":"88a70cb0e75cdb8f3379e56a1a586511f3afdbe8","_resolved":"file:../d-116419-29079-d0f29/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116419-29079-d0f29/package.tgz"}
