## Make It Awesome
```bash
make_it_awesome.sh
```
Run on a new Mac and get ready for awesomeness!



## Symlinks
Create symlinks by running
 ```bash
 make_symlinks.sh (-a|--atom)
 ```

 ```-a | --atom``` creates a symlink from ```~/dotfiles/atom``` to ```~/.atom```.  This will copy all config ```.cson``` files and the [package-sync](https://atom.io/packages/package-sync) package file that will allow re-syncing of packages.
